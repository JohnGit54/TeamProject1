# TeamProject1

Using HTML and CSS/Pure (https://purecss.io/) I've created a set of div containers that will have information pushed into them and then formatted for the project. When a user searches for a movie, the search results appear in the containers and display a title, release year, poster, trailer, rating, synopsis, and a checkbox for the user to select whichever movie they'd like.

For geolocation services a modal was created to grab the user's location or allow the user to input a zip code of their choice. The modal will then close and a map of the surrounding area will appear with pins indicating movie theaters and/or resturants.
