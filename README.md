## Backend - API used:
1. TheMovieDB API
2. International Showtime API
3. Google Maps API
4. Zomato API for restaurant search 

## Backend - Coding Programs:
1. CSS
2. Bootstap
3. Pure
4. Javascript
5. JQuery
6. HTML

## Frontend - User's APP view

### View 1
As an user, he/she will see an attractive front page to assist him/her with a movie submission form. The search terms are "Movie Title". The user input the search term to generate result.

### View 2
Upon submission, it calls out a page showing the movie release date, plot/overview, poster and trailer. User will see the details in a neat and structured layout showing the details to help him with the decision - "Should I watch this movie?".

### View 3
User decides to watch the movie by submitting a button to call for movie theater near him/her. A modal box will appear for the user if the movie is showing not in theatre. User can also choose to have a button to choose a result o allow current location capture or self input zipcode to select the movie theatre near him/her.

### View 4
This page shows the theater currently showing the movie near him/her. It will show a google embed map view.

A button will allow user to call up restuarants near him/her. THhs brings a nice closure to the user. A glass of wine to celebrate for a successful planning.
